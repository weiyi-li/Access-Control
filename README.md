# Access-Control
Access control module based on Arduino Nano, require hardware support (RFID reader and servo)
Components
The entire system is composed of three core modules, which are solar power module, access control module and LCD display module.
Detailed use of every key component of the early prototype is demonstrated below.
Solar power module:
-	Solar panel: provide auxiliary power supply directly to the power banks
Access control module:
-	RFID reader: read information in an ID card.
-	Servo: rotate and make the doors open.
-	Magnet switch: which is used to control the status of door lock.
