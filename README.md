# Access-Control
Access control module based on Arduino Nano, require hardware support (RFID reader and servo)<br>Components:<br>The entire system is composed of three core modules, which are solar power module, access control module and LCD display module.<br>Detailed use of every key component of the early prototype is demonstrated below.<br>Solar power module:&nbsp; <br>-&nbsp;Solar panel: provide auxiliary power supply directly to the power banks<br>Access control module:&nbsp; <br>-&nbsp;RFID reader: read information in an ID card.<br>-&nbsp;Servo: rotate and make the doors open.<br>-&nbsp;Magnet switch: which is used to control the status of door lock.<br>LCD display module:&nbsp; <br>-&nbsp;LCD1602 screen: deliver text.<br>-&nbsp;Clock module: used for chronograph.
