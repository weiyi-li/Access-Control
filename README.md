# Access-Control
Access control module based on Arduino Nano, require hardware support (RFID reader and servo)
## Components  
The entire system is composed of three core modules, which are solar power module, access control module and LCD display module. Detailed use of every key component of the early prototype is demonstrated below.  
### **Solar power module**:  
Solar panel: provide auxiliary power supply directly to the power banks  
### **Access control module**:  
RFID reader: read information in an ID card  
Servo: rotate and make the doors open  
Magnet switch: control the status of door lock  
### **LCD display module**:  
LCD1602 screen: deliver text  
Clock module: used for chronograph
